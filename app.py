"""
app.py - High-Performance Multi-Threaded Gesture Platform Hub (v3.0 - Cloud Edition)

Cloud-deploy architecture change (v3.0):
Cloud hosts (Render, Streamlit Cloud, etc.) run headless containers with NO
physical webcam attached, so `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` on the server can never see
the *player's* camera - it can only ever try (and fail) to see a server camera
that doesn't exist. Frame capture therefore now happens in the BROWSER via
getUserMedia, and each frame is POSTed to /process_frame for MediaPipe
inference. Rendering stays server-side, unchanged.

- Thread (_game_render_worker): Strict 30 FPS physics update and off-screen rendering
- /process_frame: receives a JPEG frame captured by the client's own webcam,
  runs MediaPipe gesture inference on it, and stores the latest result
- /api/stats: Dedicated endpoint for seamless DOM updates with ZERO page reload
"""

# GameManager (imported below) uses pygame purely as an off-screen 2D renderer -

# Streamlit Cloud, etc.) have no display or sound device, and SDL's real
# video/audio drivers can fail or hang trying to find one. Forcing the
# "dummy" drivers before pygame is imported anywhere makes pygame.init()
# succeed reliably on any headless host.

# --- Frame hand-off between the HTTP layer and the inference thread ---
# /process_frame used to decode + run MediaPipe inline, inside the request
# handler. That works, but it means the client's fetch() doesn't resolve
# until a full inference pass finishes - so if a frame takes 150ms to
# process, the browser's capture loop is effectively throttled to that
# speed too, and any backlog makes hand tracking feel laggy.
# Instead, /process_frame just stashes the newest raw frame and returns
# immediately (sub-millisecond), while a single dedicated thread pulls
# whatever the newest frame is and runs inference on it continuously. Old,
# not-yet-processed frames are simply dropped - we only ever care about the
# most recent one, since this is a live control signal, not a queue to drain.
